# Just Planning Poker
Just Planning Poker is a simple lightweight planning poker web application. It runs in-memory, and thus only requires a web application to host and run the tool.

It is written in .Net Core 3.1, using [Blazor WebAssembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-3.1#blazor-webassembly).

It is designed to replace face-to-face planning poker, since most development teams are working remotely, following the global pandemic that resulted in office shut-downs in most of the world.
